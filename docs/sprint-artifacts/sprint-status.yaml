#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', dev reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'
#
# SPRINT 0 PREREQUISITES:
# =======================
# Before starting Epic 1, complete these Sprint 0 tasks:
# - [ ] Create golden test dataset (100+ annotated documents)
# - [ ] Configure E2E framework (Playwright)
